# HENS
HTML Educational Node.js System (HENS) 
An applied system for web development  
 
HENS is a portable system for software development.  The focus is on HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, and SQLite.  The system provides all the applications required for developers to start developing web applications.  The HTML Educational Node.js System (HENS) does not require installation or admin access allowing for portability. This environment is built using open source applications.  

HENS was published at the Global Online Conference on Information and Computer Technology: http://www.virtualcict.org/.  The HENS paper is in this repo:  HENS.docx.

Note - only clone/fork HENS if you are going to contribute or extent HENS.  Reason, when you clone - it pulls down the .git for HENS.  This is tied to the repo.  By downloading the zip, there is no associated repo allowing you to setup your project repos under the code folder (or any folder).
 

## Thoughts
I started HENS to help students get started on web development.  What evolved over a few months was an environment that I use for my own projects.  After several iterations, many have helped me test and use HENS.  

Go ahead and contribute or fork - add code or packages that meet your needs.  Enjoy the Code!  Brian.
